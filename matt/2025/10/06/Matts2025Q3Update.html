          <p>We are excited to announce that the Decimal (<a href="https://github.com/cppalliance/decimal">https://github.com/cppalliance/decimal</a>) library is going back to review for inclusion in Boost from 06 to 15 October.
In preparation for this we have made quite a few changes since the indeterminate end of the first review about 9 months ago:</p>

<p>Breaking Changes:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Based on bitwise comparisons with other similar libraries and database software, we have changed the internal encoding of our IEEE 754-compliant types</li>
  <li>We spent about 3 months optimizing just back end integer types that are now used throughout the library, and as the internals of decimal128_t</li>
  <li>We have changed the type names to better match conventions:
    <ul>
      <li><code>decimalXX</code> is now <code>decimalXX_t</code></li>
      <li><code>decimalXX_fast</code> is now <code>decimal_fastXX_t</code></li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>The headers have been similarly renamed (e.g. decimal32.hpp -&gt; decimal32_t.hpp), and can now be used independently instead of requiring the monolith based on feedback in Review</li>
  <li>Constructors have been simplified to reduce confusion (no more double negative logic)</li>
  <li>The default rounding mode has changed to align with IEEE 754, with rounding bugs being squashed across the modes as well</li>
</ul>

<p>Other Changes:</p>
<ul>
  <li>The documenation content has been overhauled thanks to feedback from Peter Turcan and others during the first review</li>
  <li>The docs are no longer a single long page of Asciidoc; we have moved to Antora. Thanks to Joaquín and Christian for making it trivial to copy from Unordered to make that happen.
    <ul>
      <li>https://develop.decimal.cpp.al/</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>We now support formatting with {fmt}</li>
  <li>Benchmarks have been expanded to include GCC <code>_DecimalXX</code> types, and Intel’s libbid. I think people should be pleased with the results now, since that was a huge point of contention at the end of the review</li>
  <li>We have added support for CMake pkg config for ease of use</li>
  <li>Every post-review issue John was kind enough to consolidate and open have been addressed: https://github.com/cppalliance/decimal/issues?q=is%3Aissue%20state%3Aclosed%20label%3A%22Boost%20Review%22</li>
</ul>

<p>Continued Developments:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>I think the only unaddressed comment from the first review is support for hardware decimal floating point types.
There are a few rarer architectures that have native decimal floating point units like POWER10.
Is it possible to fully integrate these native types for use in the library?
Armed with a compiler farm account I have begun developing a wrapper around the native types that seems to work.
Stay tuned.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One item that we have considered, but have not put any effort into yet would be getting the library running on CUDA platforms.
If this is a feature that you are interested in, please let us know!</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As is always the case with Boost reviews, regardless of the outcome I am sure that we will receive lots of feedback on how to improve the library.</p>
  </li>
</ul>
