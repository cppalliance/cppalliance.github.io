<p>New in Boost 1.85 is a number of optimization algorithms (https://www.boost.org/doc/libs/1_85_0/libs/math/doc/html/optimization.html) developed by Nick Thompson.
This sub-library contains both classical (random_search), and novel (jSO) algorithms.
I was able to assist him in the development and debugging of multi-threaded code which is never an easy task.</p>
