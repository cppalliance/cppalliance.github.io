<p>Decimal (https://github.com/cppalliance/decimal) is a ground-up implementation of the IEEE 754 Decimal Floating Point types in C++14, and is co-authored by Chris Kormanyos.
The past few months we have worked hard to squeeze more performance out of the library, and we believe we have successfully accomplished that. 
By request we have also added functions to covert between the Binary Integer Significand Field (BID) and the Densely Packed Decimal Significand Field (DPD) encoding formats.

A few weeks ago we received endorsement for Boost formal review which is now scheduled for 13-22 January 2025.
Feel free to use the library and ask any questions prior to the review period.
Discussion of this library can be found on the Cpplang slack at <code>#boost-decimal</code>.</p>

<p>As the headline says CUDA support has come to Boost.Math this summer! 
After much work and discussion with not only with the Boost maintainers but also with SciPy and CuPy maintainers we have added support for CUDA (NVCC and NVRTC), and SYCL to much of the library.
You will find many of the Special Functions, Statistical Distributions, and even some quadrature can now be run on device.
