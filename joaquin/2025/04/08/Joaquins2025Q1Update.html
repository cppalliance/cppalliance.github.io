          <p>During Q1 2025, I’ve been working in the following areas:</p>

<h3 id="candidate-boost-bloom-library">Candidate Boost Bloom Library</h3>

<p>During the entire quarter I’ve been working on a Boost proposal around Bloom filters:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Repo: <a href="https://github.com/joaquintides/bloom">https://github.com/joaquintides/bloom</a></li>
  <li>Docs: <a href="https://master.bloom.cpp.al/">https://master.bloom.cpp.al/</a></li>
</ul>

<p>Class template <code>boost::bloom::filter</code> can be configured to implement a classical Bloom filter
as well as variations discussed in the literature such as block filters, multiblock filters, and more.</p>

<pre><code class="language-cpp">#include &lt;boost/bloom/filter.hpp&gt;
#include &lt;cassert&gt;
#include &lt;string&gt;

int main()
{
  // Bloom filter of strings with 5 bits set per insertion
  using filter = boost::bloom::filter&lt;std::string, 5&gt;;

  // create filter with a capacity of 1'000'000 **bits**
  filter f(1'000'000);

  // insert elements (they can't be erased, Bloom filters are insert-only)
  f.insert("hello");
  f.insert("Boost");
  //...

  // elements inserted are always correctly checked as such
  assert(f.may_contain("hello") == true);

  // elements not inserted may incorrectly be identified as such with a
  // false positive rate (FPR) which is a function of the array capacity,
  // the number of bits set per element and generally how the boost::bloom::filter
  // was specified
  if(f.may_contain("bye")) { // likely false
    //...
  }
}
</code></pre>
<p>The library is ready for official review, which I plan to ask for in April. Chris Mazakas
is helping with a very useful vcpkg registry so that future reviewers can
download and install candidate Boost.Bloom and dependencies with minimal hassle via vcpkg.</p>
