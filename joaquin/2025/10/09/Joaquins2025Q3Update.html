<p><a href="https://www.boost.org/doc/libs/latest/libs/bloom/doc/html/bloom.html">Boost.Bloom</a> has been officially
released in Boost 1.89. I’ve continued working on a number of roadmap features:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Originally, some subfilters (<code>block</code>, <code>fast_multiblock32</code> and <code>fast_multiblock64)</code>
