Updated the is_avalanching trait protocol (PR#250, to be released in Boost 1.86.0). Did some maintenance work on the CI infrastructure (PR#253, PR#254). Tested the ability of concurrent containers to work when accessed through shared memory by different processes, and fixed the stats component for this scenario as well (PR#258).

  <li>Updated the <code>is_avalanching</code> trait protocol (<a href="https://github.com/boostorg/unordered/pull/250">PR#250</a>, to be released in Boost 1.86.0).</li>
  <li>Did some maintenance work on the CI infrastructure (<a href="https://github.com/boostorg/unordered/pull/253">PR#253</a>, <a href="https://github.com/boostorg/unordered/pull/254">PR#254</a>).</li>

</ul>

<h3 id="support-to-the-community">Support to the community</h3>

<p>I try to help Boost authors and users in those areas where I have some expertise. In particular:</p>

<ul>
  <li>I’ve been reviewing and discussing Alfredo Correa’s <a href="https://gitlab.com/correaa/boost-multi">Boost.Multi</a> upcoming proposal. I hope Alfredo will get a review slot very soon.</li>
  <li>Ion Gaztañaga is writing a <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1VdMTheFUczC946dP3VKPseOoUq3sVKjU73oMvK8FE3o/edit#heading=h.3i7eohxxi73i">development plan</a> for Boost.Container to which I have provided some minor contributions.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="wg21-boost-and-the-ways-of-standardization">WG21, Boost, and the ways of standardization</h3>

<p>Many (and often opposing) opinions are being circulated about the innovation processes of WG21 and the role Boost plays in them.
In order to organize my ideas, and as a small contribution to this discussion, I wrote an <a href="https://bannalia.blogspot.com/2024/05/wg21-boost-and-ways-of-standardization.html">article</a>
that hopefully can add some value to the discussion. In particular, I think that library innovation should not aim for standardization as a default
goal, and provided a <a href="https://bannalia.blogspot.com/2024/05/wg21-boost-and-ways-of-standardization.html#an-assessment-model-for-library-standardization">conceptual model</a> for the assessment of standardization pros and cons.</p>
