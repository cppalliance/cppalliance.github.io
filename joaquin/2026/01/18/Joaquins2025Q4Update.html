<h3 id="experiments-with-fil-c">Experiments with Fil-C</h3>

<p><a href="https://fil-c.org/">Fil-C</a> is a C and C++ compiler built on top of LLVM that adds run-time
memory-safety mechanisms preventing out-of-bounds and use-after-free accesses. 
I’ve been experimenting with compiling Boost.Unordered test suite with Fil-C and running
some benchmarks to measure the resulting degradation in execution times and memory usage.
Results follow:</p>

  </li>
</ul>

<h3 id="proof-of-concept-of-a-semistable-vector">Proof of concept of a semistable vector</h3>

<p>By “semistable vector” I mean that pointers to the elements may be invalidated
upon insertion and erasure (just like a regular <code>std::vector</code>) but iterators
to non-erased elements remain valid throughout.
I’ve written a small <a href="https://github.com/joaquintides/semistable_vector/">proof of concept</a>
of this idea and measured its performance against non-stable <code>std::vector</code> and fully
stable <code>std::list</code>. It is dubious that such container could be of interest for production
use, but the techniques explored are mildly interesting and could be adapted, for
instance, to write powerful safe iterator facilities.</p>

<h3 id="teaser-exploring-the-stdhive-space">Teaser: exploring the <code>std::hive</code> space</h3>

<p>In short, <code>std::hive</code> (coming in C++26) is a container with stable references/iterators
and fast insertion and erasure. The <a href="https://github.com/mattreecebentley/plf_hive">reference implementation</a>
for this container relies on a rather convoluted data structure, and I started to wonder
if something simpler could deliver superior performance. Expect to see the results of
my experiments in Q1 2026.</p>
