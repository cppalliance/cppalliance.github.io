<p>After studying Mathematics at Cambridge University, I have been programming for over 20 years, mostly in the trading/financial sector. My career has encompassed various languages but mostly C++, which is my preferred language for its performance and flexibility. Since 2021 I have been an active participant on the C++ Standardisation Committee (WG21), representing the Irish national body.</p>

<p>When not programming, I enjoy walking my dogs through the countryside around my home in rural Ireland.</p>
