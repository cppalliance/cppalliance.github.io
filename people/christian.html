<p>Christian received his B.Sc. in physics where he studied cosmological simulation software which introduced him to C++ and a love of programming. He's worked in the web development industry for 5+ years and spent 2 years writing computer vision-based software routines in OpenCV. He fell in love with C++ and Boost after spending too much on the cpplang slack. When not programming, he enjoys wood-fired cooking and searching for the next greatest beers.</p>
