<p>Jeremy is an open-source focused full stack web developer with a primary focus in the Python programming language and the Django Framework. Having started as a Physics major, he quickly fell in love with programming and being an engineer, and hasn't looked back in his 8 year long career. When not digging through esoteric bug reports (or writing one himself) he enjoys miniature painting, table top rpgs, and amateur power lifting.</p>
