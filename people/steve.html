<p>
Steve Gerbino is a software engineer specializing in blockchain technology and open-source development. He co-architected the Koinos Blockchain — a fast, feeless, developer-centric smart contract platform built on the principle that powerful technology means nothing if ordinary people can't use it.
</p>

<p>
He also contributed to the Steem Blockchain, working on core protocol development including consensus validation, performance optimization, and state management. Previously, he worked in FinTech on Openlink's flagship application Endur/Findur, an industry leader in transaction lifecycle management for supermajors like Shell and ExxonMobil.
</p>

<p>
His hobbies include playing blues on the guitar, swimming in the Mediterranean, and calling new programming languages a flavor of the month before returning to C++.
