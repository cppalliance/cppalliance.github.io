<p>
  Enjoying family and friends in the beautiful city of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Sebasti%C3%A1n">San Sebastian</a>, Ion is a telecom engineer from the <a href="https://www.ehu.eus/en/web/bilboko-ingeniaritza-eskola/">University of the Basque Country</a>. At the Faculty of Engineering he started coding in C++, with the SGI STL code as the best teacher.

  Never got over his childhood games, so Ion has been playing with trains for many years, designing and programming embedded and safety-critical systems.

  He joined Boost in 2005 and still maintains and extends several libraries: Move, Container, Intrusive and Interprocess.
