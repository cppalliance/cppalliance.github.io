          <p>AI generated code has some fun side effects.

My simplistic conclusion is that a C++ AI model will get the code right as long as you don’t veer too far from the standard language and the fewer libraries the better. In my also simplistic opinion this is not ready for prime time - we all use, and want to use, libraries to take much of the heavy-lifting away from development effort and time.</p>

<p>Investigating the use of the enormous precision available using libraries such as Boost.Multiprecision, I am impressed by the huge prime numbers used in cryptography and the accuracy of constants in science such as astrophysics (gravitational constants, pi, zeta constants in string theory and the like). At the same time - fun fact - NASA’s orbital calculations use only around 15 digits of pi to get very precise orbits, so precision can become an obsession devolved of any practical application!</p>

<p>With recent library releases, such as Boost.Hash, it seemed prudent to add pertinent hash terminology to the User Guide Glossary - help the uninitiated understand what it’s all about. Same for Open Methods and Bloom Filters - all adding more terminology to our already overloaded capacity. Another fun fact - Bloom filters are not named after anything to do with blooming - but simply after the name of the inventor - Burton Howard Bloom.</p>

<p>Testing Boost libraries did pique my imagination several times. Many years ago, working with a smart human friend - a computer analyst - we devised a language to be used for giving orders in a battle simulation. “Marshal Davout, order one infantry and one cavalry division to attack the hill to the NorthEast”, for example. This involved three distinct steps - syntax analysis to check for correct wording, semantic analysis to check for correct grammar, and interpretation. The first two steps are logical and complete. The third step - interpretation is a toughie - “is there a hill to the NorthEast?”  -  and if not, what do I do? Similarly, “what if I have two infantry divisions available, but no cavalry, should I still attack?”.  Duh - interpretation can be ambiguous and difficult.
