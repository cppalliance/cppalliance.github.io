          <h1 id="boostjson">Boost.JSON</h1>

<p>Boost.JSON is officially scheduled for review! It starts on September 14th, so there isn’t much time left to finish up polishing the library – but it looks like we will make the deadline.</p>

<h2 id="optimize-optimize-optimize">Optimize, optimize, optimize</h2>

<p>Boost.JSON’s performance has significantly increased in the past month. The change to the parsing functions where we pass and return <code>const char*</code> instead of <code>result</code> (detailed in my last post) was merged, bringing large gains across the board. After this, my work on optimizing <code>basic_parser</code> was complete (for now…), save for a few more minor changes:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>The handler is stored as the first data member as opposed to passing a reference to each parse function. This means that the <code>this</code> pointer for <code>basic_parser</code> is the <code>this</code> pointer for the handler, which eliminates some register spills.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The parser’s depth (i.e. nesting level of objects/arrays) is now tracked as <code>max_depth - actual_depth</code>, meaning that we don’t have to read <code>max_depth</code> from memory each time a structure is parsed.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><code>parse_string</code> was split into two functions: <code>parse_unescaped</code> and <code>parse_escaped</code>. The former is much cheaper to call as it doesn’t have to store the string within a local buffer, and since unescaped strings are vastly more common in JSON documents, this increases performance considerably.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3 id="the-dom-parser">The DOM parser</h3>

<p>Our old implementation of <code>parser</code> was pretty wasteful. It stored state information (such as whether we were parsing an object or array), keys, and values, all on one stack. This proved to be quite a pain when it came to unwinding it and also required us to align the stack when pushing arrays and objects.</p>

<p>Several months ago, Vinnie and I tried to figure out how to make the homogeneous but came to a dead end. I decided to revisit the idea, and after some experimentation, it became apparent that there was a <em>lot</em> of redundancy in the implementation. For example, <code>basic_parser</code> already keeps track of the current object/array/string/key size, so there is no reason to so within <code>parser</code>. The state information we were tracking was also not needed – <code>basic_parser</code> already checks the syntactic correctness of the input. That left one more thing: strings and keys.</p>

<p>My rudimentary implementation required two stacks: one for keys and strings, and the other for values. Other information, such as the sizes of objects and arrays, were obtained from <code>basic_parser</code>. My implementation, though primitive, gave some promising results on the benchmarks: up to 10% for certain documents. After some brainstorming with Vinnie, he had the idea of storing object keys as values; the last piece of the puzzle we needed to make this thing work.</p>

<p>His fleshed-out implementation was even faster. In just a week’s time, Boost.JSON’s performance increased by some 15%. I’m still working on the finishing touches, but the results are looking promising.</p>

<h2 id="more-utf-8-validation-malarkey">More UTF-8 validation malarkey</h2>

<p>Out of all the things I’ve worked on, nothing has proved as frustrating as UTF-8 validation. The validation itself is trivial; but making it work with an incremental parser is remarkably difficult. Shortly after merging the feature, <a href="https://github.com/CPPAlliance/json/issues/162">an issue was opened</a>; while validation worked just fine when a document was parsed without suspending, I neglected to write tests for incremental parsing, and that’s precisely where the bug was. Turns out, if parsing suspended while validating a UTF-8 byte sequence, the handler just would not be called.</p>

<p>This was… quite a problem to say the least, and required me to reimplement UTF-8 validation from scratch – but with a twist. We don’t want to pass partial UTF-8 sequences because it just transfers the burden of assembling incomplete sequences to the handler. This means that we need to store the sequences, append to them until we get a complete codepoint, and only then can we validate and send it off to the handler. Doing this in an efficient manner proved to be quite challenging, so I ended up with a “fix” that was 50% code and 50% <code>// KRYSTIAN TODO: this can be optimized</code>. The tests provided in the issue finally passed, so the patch was merged.</p>

<p>I thought my woes with validation were over, but I was wrong. Just over a week later, a new issue rolled in:</p>

<p><a href="https://github.com/CPPAlliance/json/issues/162">Handler not invoked correctly in multi-byte UTF8 sequences, part 2</a></p>

<p>Luckily, fixing this didn’t require another rewrite. This taught me a fine lesson in exhaustive testing.</p>
