CppLang Slack Code of Conduct
=============================

The CppLang Slack team lives at [cpplang.slack.com](https://cpplang.slack.com). New members may join [here](https://cpplang.now.sh/).

Introduction
------------

- Diversity and inclusion make our community strong. We encourage participation from the most varied and diverse backgrounds possible and want to be very clear about where we stand.
- Our goal is to maintain a safe, helpful and friendly community for **everyone**.
- This code and related procedures also apply to unacceptable behaviour occurring outside the scope of community activities, in all community venues— online and in-person— as well as in all one-on-one communications, and anywhere such behaviour has the potential to adversely affect the safety or well-being of community members.

Expected Behaviour
-----------------

- Be welcoming.
- Be kind.
- Look out for each other.

Unacceptable Behaviour
---------------------

The following behaviours are unacceptable in all CppLang Slack channels, and in any physical or online events officially organised by its administrative team:

- Violence, threats of violence or violent language directed against another person.
- Sexist, racist, homophobic, transphobic, ableist or otherwise discriminatory jokes and language.
- Posting or displaying sexually explicit or violent material.
- Posting or threatening to post other people’s personally identifying information ("doxing").
- Personal insults, particularly those related to gender, sexual orientation, ethnicity, religion, or disability.
- Inappropriate photography or recording.
- Inappropriate physical contact. You should have someone’s consent before touching them.
- Unwelcome sexual attention. This includes sexualised comments or jokes, inappropriate touching, groping, and unwelcomed sexual advances.
- Deliberate intimidation, stalking or following (online or in person).
- Advocating for, or encouraging, any of the above behaviour.
- Sustained disruption of community events, including talks and presentations.

Enforcement
-----------

- Understand that speech and actions have consequences, and unacceptable behaviour will not be tolerated.
- If you are the subject of, or witness to any violations of this Code of Conduct, please contact us by submitting a form [here](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfQYuWg_RzAeNLU-gFhZwI7wzforza4asesMnGH2hC5amwkGA/viewform), or contact an administrator directly. An up-to-date list of administrators can be found [here](https://cpplang.slack.com/account/team) or by clicking the `⋮` the top-right of the Slack UI, going to "Workspace Directory" and filtering by "Admins". Alternatively, you can use the `!admins` Slackbot command to get the link.
- If violations occur, organisers will take any action they deem appropriate for the infraction, up to and including expulsion.
- Moderation guidelines can be found [here]({{site.baseurl}}/moderation).
  - If you believe that an administrator has not followed the moderation guidelines properly, please report this using the same methods as a Code of Conduct violation.

Private Channels
----------------

Currently private channels are moderated only by those members who are invited to that channel. They are given a degree of autonomy, and this will be maintained so long as this trust is not abused. Do **not** invite people into private channels who did not consent to being there. CoC violation reports regarding discussion from private channels will be subject to the same consideration as in public channels.


Meta
----

- This document is managed on GitHub.
- Pull requests can be sent [here](https://github.com/CPPAlliance/cppalliance.github.io).
