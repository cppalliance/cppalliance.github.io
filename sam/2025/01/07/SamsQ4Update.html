<meta name="description" content="Here’s an overview of some projects I have been working on the last few months. Jenkins The main focus this quarter has been an overhaul of the Jenkins installation. We have been running a Jenkins instance to generate documentation previews for many Boost repositories, as well as JSON benchmarks, and lcov/gcovr code coverage analysis. The jobs were configured as Freestyle Projects, the “classic, general-purpose job type”. These have all now been replaced by “Multibranch Pipeline”. Each category of job type uses a Jenkinsfile (list of Jenkinsfiles) with the most common being “standard_libraries_1”. Even when multiple jobs vary slightly they may still use the same consolidated Jenkinsfile, and then load pre- and post-build scripts to modify small details. Here is a current list of jobs. An advantage of Multibranch Pipeline is the job configurations are more “open-source” than before. The code is visible at https://github.com/cppalliance/jenkins-ci, whereas before with the Freestyle Projects that was not the case. Also, the multibranch plugin UI handles pull requests better than the previous ‘GitHub Pull Request Builder’. Each PR is given its own dedicated page and sub-configuration. Each PR can be stopped, started, restarted, disabled, etc. It’s easier to work with than before. The downside (if any) is that the configuration of pipelines must be composed in their Groovy based DSL (domain specific language) which is not YAML, or Python. The syntax can be unexpected, but accomplishing most basic tasks is fairly straight-forward. Examples can be found on many websites. Since nearly every new Job requires debugging before it goes live, there are new scripts to automate the process of testing new jobs on a github fork, right away, without manually setting up the arrangement of forking a repo, duplicating the job, etc. By the way - why choose Jenkins over Github Actions or another hosted service? I discussed that in an earlier blog post “Automated Documentation Previews”. See the review of security considerations there. Besides security, it’s also convenient that target repositories don’t need to do anything, whether that be merging additional files, or configuring widely distributed “secrets”. For the developer, the preview jobs are automatic. Boost website boostorg/website-v2 Completely reinstalled the website database servers, staging and production. The purpose was to upgrade Ubuntu, and Postgres, without disrupting the existing instances. Minor improvements of the Fastly CDN configuration. Process 404s. Opened a ticket with Fastly to debug unexpected TTLs. Resolved. Revamping IP addresses on the k8s network to use certain private IPs. Devising an http redirect from boost.io to boost.org, to enable later. Set up downloads.cppalliance.org, initially for hosting release reports. Collaborating with web developers, discussing the CDN, deployments, browser cookies, documentation releases, mailman db access, logs. Advised on boostlook CI workflow design. Boost release process boostorg/release-tools Added features to build_docs scripts to install boostlook, antora, as well as testing mrdocs. Built newer release-tools docker images, with new gems/pip packages. This has been uploaded to Docker Hub. Sent PR to boostorg/geometry regarding docs builds. Sent PR to boostorg/gil, boostorg/python, to fix newer Sphinx. Designed a feature to contact boost.io via a webhook during a new boost version release in publish_release.py.

          <p>Here’s an overview of some projects I have been working on the last few months.</p>

<h3 id="jenkins">Jenkins</h3>

<p>The main focus this quarter has been an overhaul of the Jenkins installation. We have been running a Jenkins instance to generate documentation previews for many Boost repositories, as well as JSON benchmarks, and lcov/gcovr code coverage analysis. The jobs were configured as Freestyle Projects, the “classic, general-purpose job type”. These have all now been replaced by “Multibranch Pipeline”. Each category of job type uses a Jenkinsfile <a href="https://github.com/cppalliance/jenkins-ci/blob/master/jenkinsfiles/">(list of Jenkinsfiles)</a> with the most common being “<a href="https://github.com/cppalliance/jenkins-ci/blob/master/jenkinsfiles/standard_libraries_1">standard_libraries_1</a>”. Even when multiple jobs vary slightly they may still use the same consolidated Jenkinsfile, and then load <a href="https://github.com/cppalliance/jenkins-ci/tree/master/scripts">pre- and post-build scripts</a> to modify small details. Here is a current <a href="https://github.com/cppalliance/jenkins-ci/blob/master/docs/inventory.md">list of jobs</a>.</p>

<p>An advantage of Multibranch Pipeline is the job configurations are more “open-source” than before. The code is visible at https://github.com/cppalliance/jenkins-ci, whereas before with the Freestyle Projects that was not the case.</p>

<p>Also, the multibranch plugin UI handles pull requests better than the previous ‘GitHub Pull Request Builder’. Each PR is given its own dedicated page and sub-configuration. Each PR can be stopped, started, restarted, disabled, etc. It’s easier to work with than before.</p>

<p>The downside (if any) is that the configuration of pipelines must be composed in their Groovy based DSL (domain specific language) which is not YAML, or Python. The syntax can be unexpected, but accomplishing most basic tasks is fairly straight-forward.  Examples can be found on many websites.</p>

<p>Since nearly every new Job requires debugging before it goes live, there are new scripts to automate the process of testing new jobs on a github fork, right away, without manually setting up the arrangement of forking a repo, duplicating the job, etc.</p>

<p>By the way - why choose Jenkins over Github Actions or another hosted service? I discussed that in an earlier blog post “Automated Documentation Previews”. See the review of security considerations there. Besides security, it’s also convenient that target repositories don’t need to do anything, whether that be merging additional files, or configuring widely distributed “secrets”. For the developer, the preview jobs are automatic.</p>

<h3 id="boost-website-boostorgwebsite-v2">Boost website boostorg/website-v2</h3>

<p>Completely reinstalled the website database servers, staging and production. The purpose was to upgrade Ubuntu, and Postgres, without disrupting the existing instances.</p>

<p>Minor improvements of the Fastly CDN configuration. Process 404s.</p>

<p>Opened a ticket with Fastly to debug unexpected TTLs. Resolved.</p>

<p>Revamping IP addresses on the k8s network to use certain private IPs.</p>

<p>Devising an http redirect from boost.io to boost.org, to enable later.</p>

<p>Set up downloads.cppalliance.org, initially for hosting release reports.</p>

<p>Collaborating with web developers, discussing the CDN, deployments, browser cookies, documentation releases, mailman db access, logs. Advised on boostlook CI workflow design.</p>

<h3 id="boost-release-process-boostorgrelease-tools">Boost release process boostorg/release-tools</h3>

<p>Added features to build_docs scripts to install boostlook, antora, as well as testing mrdocs.  <br />
