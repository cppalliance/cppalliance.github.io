<p>The isomorphic-git improvements are an ongoing saga. (As a reminder, isomorphic-git is a dependency and component of Antora, which can’t parse submodules while boost relies heavily on submodules). This quarter I coded full submodule support into isomorphic-git and then submitted a PR with 150 files modified. An issue is that the library is suffering from a general lack of maintainers, it’s stuck on Nodejs 14 from 5 years ago, and uses many out-of-date packages. These are preventing proper CI tests (specifically, recursive copy isn’t supported) and now the maintainer refuses to merge the pull request without a major overhaul of BrowserFS -&gt; ZenFS. It’s a complete detour since this has nothing directly to do with submodules.</p>

<p>An amusing anecdote from the story: out of the blue a developer from Germany appeared and he was very energetic about fixing everything in isomorphic-git. For a week or so, it seemed he would solve all problems. He would overhaul the entire package (which has been neglected), contribute many improvements, solve all bugs, upgrade ZenFS, etc. I was genuinely optimistic about his participation. However my latest assessment of the situation is he’s experiencing some delusions of grandeur based on comments in git repositories such as…  that upgrading isomorphic-git “will trigger a massive, multi-trillion-dollar restructuring of the digital economy”. After expressing impatience with the existing maintainers of isomorphic-git, the developer forked the repo, and has ceased to be involved directly.</p>

<p>However all is not lost. The author of ZenFS is actively working with isomorphic-git to implement the BrowserFS -&gt; ZenFS upgrade. He is contributing the pull request.</p>
