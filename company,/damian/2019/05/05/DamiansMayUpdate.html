  <li>Boost.Beast</li>
  <li>Boost.Build</li>
  <li>BeastLounge</li>
</ul>

<h1 id="certify">Certify</h1>
<p>Certify did not have any platform-independent means of caching certificate

<h1 id="boostbeast">Boost.Beast</h1>
<p>When working on making sure Beast is <code>std::launder</code>-correct, I ran into a number
of previously undiagnosed bugs in Beast. All of them have been fixed in
<a href="https://github.com/boostorg/beast/pull/1598/files">v254</a>. I was quite confused
why these issues weren’t found by CI previously. I’ve been able to track it down
to old toolchain versions in Travis. Additionally, the test matrix lacks a few
fairly important variants. Considering the fact that Trusty is no longer
supported and the switch to Xenial is inevitable, I’ve decided to port over the
CI to Azure Pipelines, because it offers better concurrency which allows the
Beast CI to afford a larger test matrix. In the process I’ve also decided to use
as many default b2 options as possible, to make future changes to the CI easier.
There’s still an issue with Valgrind in Xenial to be resolved (doesn’t support
the <code>RDRAND</code> instruction).</p>

<h1 id="boostbuild">Boost.Build</h1>
<p>While working on the AzP CI for Beast, I found out that the <code>coverage</code> feature
in <code>b2</code> doesn’t actually set build flags. <code>coverage=all</code> will now properly cause
tests to produce <code>gcno</code> and <code>gcda</code> files for consumption by the lcov tool.</p>

<h1 id="beastlounge">BeastLounge</h1>
<p>When experimenting with the BeastLounge application running on Heroku I found
out that Heroku’s router has a builtin 55s timeout which dropped websocket
connections. I solved the issue by making the websocket ping timeouts
configurable.</p>
