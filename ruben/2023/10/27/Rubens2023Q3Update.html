<meta name="description" content="During Q3 2023, I’ve been making progress in the following areas: BoostServerTech As you may know, BoostServerTech is a series of projects that showcase how Boost can be used to create high-performance web applications. It’s a place to showcase Boost technology to both authors and users, and try new stuff. I originally created the project in July as a “test lab”, to guide Boost.MySQL development. During this Q3, the project has advanced a lot: Created the project proposal. Developed the proposed chat application prototype, including a React front-end and a C++ backend using Boost.Beast and Boost.Redis. Made the project robust by developing a unit test suite for both front-end and back-end, and an integration test suite. Deployed the project to production using AWS and containers, featuring a CloudFormation template that makes new deployments very easy. Wrote extensive documentation about the project, so it can be useful for other developers, as well as other Boost authors who want to write their own ServerTech application. Extended the server’s functionality by adding authentication and a MySQL database (using Boost.MySQL). Boost.Cobalt feedback and review I’ve been quite involved in Boost.Cobalt (former Boost.Async) submission and review process: Provided Klemens with early feedback about documentation, prior to review. I wrote a fork of the BoostServerTech chat application using Boost.Cobalt. This uncovered some issues and yielded some useful experience that the author has already incorporated into the library. I wrote my review with all this. Boost.MySQL Implemented fuzz testing for Boost.MySQL serialization functions. Fixed minor issues and released Boost.MySQL 1.83. Implemented connection::reset_session, which allows cleaning session state and is a requirement for connection pooling. Site docs I’ve done some contributions to the new Boost documentation: I wrote the fuzz testing guide. I provided some feedback about other pages." />

          <p>During Q3 2023, I’ve been making progress in the following areas:</p>

<h3 id="boostservertech">BoostServerTech</h3>

<p>As you may know, <a href="https://github.com/anarthal/servertech-chat">BoostServerTech</a> is a series of projects that showcase how Boost can be used
to create high-performance web applications. It’s a place to showcase Boost technology to both
authors and users, and try new stuff.</p>

<p>I originally created the project in July as a “test lab”, to guide Boost.MySQL development.
During this Q3, the project has advanced a lot:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Created the <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ZQrod1crs8EaNLLqSYIRMacwR3Rv0hC5l-gfL-jOp2M/edit">project proposal</a>.</li>
  <li>Developed the proposed chat application prototype, including a React front-end and a C++ backend using Boost.Beast and Boost.Redis.</li>
  <li>Made the project robust by developing a unit test suite for both front-end and back-end, and an integration test suite.</li>
  <li>Deployed the project to production using AWS and containers, featuring a CloudFormation template that makes new deployments very easy.</li>

  <li>Extended the server’s functionality by adding authentication and a MySQL database (using Boost.MySQL).</li>

<p>I’ve been quite involved in Boost.Cobalt (former Boost.Async) submission and review process:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Provided Klemens with early feedback about documentation, prior to review.</li>
  <li>I wrote a fork of the BoostServerTech chat application using Boost.Cobalt. This uncovered some issues and yielded some useful experience that the author has already incorporated into the library.</li>
  <li>I wrote my review with all this.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="boostmysql">Boost.MySQL</h3>

<ul>
  <li>Implemented fuzz testing for Boost.MySQL serialization functions.</li>
  <li>Fixed minor issues and released Boost.MySQL 1.83.</li>
  <li>Implemented <code>connection::reset_session</code>, which allows cleaning session state and is a requirement for connection pooling.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="site-docs">Site docs</h3>

<p>I’ve done some contributions to the new Boost documentation:</p>

<ul>
  <li>I wrote the <a href="https://docs.cppalliance.org/contributor-guide/testing/fuzzing.html">fuzz testing guide</a>.</li>
