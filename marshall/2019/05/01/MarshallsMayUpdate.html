<p>The next big milestone for libc++ is the LLVM 9.0 release this summer. We’re working towards that, implementing new features and fixing bugs.</p>

<p>Also, there was a series of general cleanups in the libc++ tests to improve portability and readability. I added a bunch of updates for debug-mode, and there were several places where we assumed that <code>string::compare</code> returned <code>-1/0/1</code> instead of what was specified, which is <code>\&lt;0/0/\&gt;0</code>.

<h1 id="wg21">WG21</h1>

<p>There were no WG21 meetings in April. However, LWG held three teleconferences this month, reviewing papers in advance of the July meeting.  We’ll have more teleconferences in May.</p>

<p>I am working on more “cleanup” papers similar to <a href="https://wg21.link/P1458">P1458 - Mandating the Standard Library: Clause 16 - Language support library</a>, and my <a href="https://wg21.link/P0805">P0805 - Comparing Containers</a> needs an update.</p>

<p>The goal of the July meeting is to have a “Committee Draft” (CD) of the proposed C++20 standard that can be sent out for review.</p>

<p>Also on my TODO list is to attempt to implement some of the proposals that are coming up for a vote in July (<code>flat_map</code>, text formatting, etc).</p>

<h1 id="boost">Boost</h1>

<p>We released <a href="https://www.boost.org/users/history/version_1_70_0.html">Boost 1.70</a> on the 12th of April.</p>

<p>Once again, I was the release manager, which involved a bunch of “process management”; things like assembling the release candidates, packaging up release notes, deciding which problems that came up would be fixed (and which ones would not), and updating the web site (and so on, and so on).</p>

<h1 id="conferences">Conferences</h1>

<p>This was a big travel month.  I gave two presentations:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>At the <a href="https://llvm.org/devmtg/2019-04/">LLVM European Developer’s conference</a> in Brussels, I gave a 30 minute overview of the changes that were coming to the standard library for C++20.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>At <a href="https://conference.accu.org/">ACCU</a> in Bristol, England, I gave a talk titled <a href="https://conference.accu.org/2019/sessions.html#XNavigatingthedevelopmentandevolutionofalibrary">“Navigating the development and evolution of a library”</a></p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>In May, I will be speaking at:</p>
<ul>
  <li><a href="http://www.cppnow.org">CppNow</a>, May 5-10 in Aspen, CO</li>
</ul>

<p>I have submitted a talk for <a href="https://www.cppcon.com">CppCon</a> in September, but I will not hear back about this for a month or two.</p>
