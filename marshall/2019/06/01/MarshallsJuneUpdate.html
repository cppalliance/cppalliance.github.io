          <p>There are four main areas where I spend my time.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Libc++, where I am the “code owner”</li>
  <li>WG21, where I am the chair of the Library Working Group (LWG)</li>
  <li>Boost</li>
  <li>Speaking at conferences</li>
</ul>

<h1 id="libc">Libc++</h1>

<p>The next big milestone for libc++ is the LLVM 9.0 release this summer. We’re working towards that, implementing new features and fixing bugs.</p>

<p>As the “code owner” for libc++, I also have to review the contributions of other people to libc++, and evaluate and fix bugs that are reported. That’s a never-ending task; there are new contributions ever day.</p>

<p>There was a lot of “infrastructure work” done on libc++ this month; a large cleanup of the test suite (still in progress), a bunch of work on debug mode for the library (also still in progress)</p>

<h3 id="lwg-issues-resolved-this-month-in-libc">LWG issues resolved this month in libc++</h3>

<ul>
  <li><a href="https://wg21.link/lwg3204">2960</a> <code>sub_match::swap</code> only swaps the base class</li>

<h3 id="llvm-features-implemented-this-month-certainly-incomplete">LLVM features implemented this month (certainly incomplete)</h3>

<ul>
  <li><a href="https://libcxx.llvm.org/cxx2a_status.html">C++20 status</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://libcxx.llvm.org/cxx1z_status.html">C++17 status</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://libcxx.llvm.org/cxx1y_status.html">C++14 status</a> (Complete)</li>
  <li><a href="https://bugs.llvm.org/buglist.cgi?bug_status=__open__&amp;product=libc%2B%2B">Libc++ open bugs</a></li>
</ul>

<h1 id="wg21">WG21</h1>

<p>There were no WG21 meetings in April. However, LWG held one teleconference this month, reviewing papers in advance of the July meeting.  We’ll have more teleconferences in June.</p>

<p>I am working on more “cleanup” papers similar to <a href="https://wg21.link/P1458">P1458 - Mandating the Standard Library: Clause 16 - Language support library</a>, and my <a href="https://wg21.link/P0805">P0805 - Comparing Containers</a> needs an update.</p>

<p>The goal of the July meeting is to have a “Committee Draft” (CD) of the proposed C++20 standard that can be sent out for review.</p>

<p>Also on my TODO list is to attempt to implement some of the proposals that are coming up for a vote in July (<code>flat_map</code>, text formatting, etc).</p>

<h1 id="boost">Boost</h1>

<p>It’s been a quiet month for boost (except for C++ Now, the conference formerly known as BoostCon).</p>

<p>There are a couple of good trip reports for C++Now:</p>
<ul>
  <li><a href="https://maddphysics.com/2019/05/13/cnow-2019-trip-report/">Matthew Butler</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://thephd.github.io/c++now-2019-trip-report">JeanHeyd Meneide</a></li>
</ul>

<p>The next <a href="https://www.boost.org/development/index.html">Boost release cycle</a> is starting soon; with the deadline for new libraries coming up later this month. I’m hoping to mentor a new release manager with this release.</p>

<h1 id="conferences">Conferences</h1>

<p>Another travel month.  I spent a bunch of time away from home, but only one conference:</p>

<ul>
  <li>At <a href="http://www.cppnow.org">C++ Now</a> in Aspen, CO, I presented “The View from a C++ Standard Library Implementor”, which was voted the runner-up for “Most Engaging” talk.</li>
</ul>

<p>I have submitted a talk for <a href="https://www.cppcon.com">CppCon</a> in September, but I will not hear back about this for a month or two.</p>

<p>I have submitted talks for <a href="https://cppconf-piter.ru/en/">C++ Russia</a> and <a href="https://meetingcpp.com">Meeting C++</a>, which are both very close (timewise) to the Belfast WG21 meeting, but I haven’t heard back yet.</p>

<p>I am looking forward to being at home for the entire month of June.</p>
