          <p>There are four main areas where I spend my time.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Libc++, where I am the “code owner”</li>
  <li>WG21, where I am the chair of the Library Working Group (LWG)</li>
  <li>Boost</li>
  <li>Speaking at conferences</li>
</ul>

<p>This month, I spent far more time reviewing other people’s code and preparing talks for conferences than the previous few months. The Boost release process consumed a fair chunk of time as well.</p>

<h1 id="libc">Libc++</h1>

<p>The big news is: we released LLVM 8 this month! (March 20th). You can get the sources and pre-built binaries from the <a href="http://releases.llvm.org/download.html#8.0.0">LLVM download page</a>, or wait for your system vendor to provide you with an update.</p>

<p>As the “code owner” for libc++, I also have to review the contributions of other people to libc++, and evaluate and fix bugs that are reported. That’s a never-ending task; there are new contributions ever day.</p>

<h3 id="lwg-papers-implemented-this-month">LWG papers implemented this month.</h3>

<ul>
  <li><a href="https://wg21.link/P0811">P0811</a> <code>std::midpoint</code> for integral and pointer types. This turned out to be <em>quite</em> involved, and spawned a <a href="https://bugs.llvm.org/show_bug.cgi?id=40965">clang bug report</a>. On the plus side, now I have a topic for a talk for CppCon this fall.</li>
</ul>

<p>Still to do, <code>std::midpoint</code> for floating point types. This is done, but it needs better tests.</p>

<h3 id="lwg-issues-implemented-this-month">LWG issues implemented this month</h3>

<ul>
  <li>I didn’t actually commit any LWG issue fixes this month. I worked with others on several bug fixes that landed, but not under my name.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="llvm-features-implemented-this-month-certainly-incomplete">LLVM features implemented this month (certainly incomplete)</h3>

<ul>
  <li>Add noexcept to <code>operator[]</code> for <code>array</code> and <code>deque</code></li>
  <li>Mark <code>vector::operator[]</code> and <code>front</code>/<code>back</code> as noexcept</li>
  <li>Mark <code>front()</code> and <code>back()</code> as noexcept for <code>array</code>/<code>deque</code>/<code>string</code>/<code>string_view</code></li>
  <li>Make <code>to_chars</code>/<code>from_chars</code> work back to C++11. This lets us use them in <code>to_string</code>.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="llvm-bugs-resolved-this-month-probably-incomplete">LLVM bugs resolved this month (probably incomplete)</h3>

<ul>
  <li><a href="https://llvm.org/35967">Bug 35967</a> &lt;regex&gt; <code>syntax_option_type</code> is not a proper bitmask</li>
  <li><em>No bug #</em> Fix a minor bug with <code>std::next</code> and <code>prev</code> not handling negative numbers.</li>
  <li><em>No bug #</em> Cleanup of requirements for <code>optional</code> - we no longer allow <code>optional&lt;const in_place_t&gt;</code></li>
  <li><a href="https://llvm.org/41130">Bug 41130</a> <code>operator/</code> of <code>std::chrono::duration</code> and custom type.</li>
</ul>

<p>Also, there was a series of general cleanups in the libc++ tests to improve portability and readability. Eric and I (mostly Eric) revamped the debug-mode support, and there will be more activity there in the future. Also, we’re moving towards using more of the <code>ASSERT_XXXX</code> macros for readability, and I revamped about 30 of the tests to use them. Only several thousand to go!</p>

<h1 id="wg21">WG21</h1>

<p>The “winter” WG21 meeting was held in Kona, HI on February 18-24. This was the last meeting for new features for C++20, and as such, it was both contentious and very busy.</p>

<p>Between now and the next meeting (July), LWG will be working on reviewing papers and issues to be adopted in July. We have had three teleconferences since Kona, and a fourth is scheduled for mid-April.</p>

<p>I am working on more “cleanup” papers similar to <a href="https://wg21.link/P1458">P1458 - Mandating the Standard Library: Clause 16 - Language support library</a>, and my <a href="https://wg21.link/P0805">P0805 - Comparing Containers</a> needs an update.</p>

<p>The goal of the July meeting is to have a “Committee Draft” (CD) of the proposed C++20 standard that can be sent out for review.</p>

<h1 id="boost">Boost</h1>

<p>It’s time for another Boost release (1.70), and I am acting as the release manager again. The release calendar is available (as always) on <a href="https://www.boost.org/development">the Boost website</a>.</p>

<p>The cut-off for contributions for the release is 3-April, with a release candidate to follow close behind, and the actual release to happen on the 10th.</p>

<p>Once the release is over, I’ll be putting some serious time into Boost.Algorithm; there are a bunch of C++17/20 algorithms that can be added to the library (among other things).</p>

<h1 id="conferences">Conferences</h1>

<p>I had submitted talk proposals to three conferences, and all three were accepted.</p>

<p>I will be speaking at:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="https://llvm.org/devmtg/2019-04">LLVM European Developer’s Conference</a>, April 8-9 in Brussels</li>
  <li><a href="https://conference.accu.org">ACCU</a>, April 10-13 in Bristol</li>
  <li><a href="http://www.cppnow.org">CppNow</a>, May 5-10 in Aspen, CO</li>
</ul>
