<p>I created a <a href="https://libcxx.llvm.org/upcoming_meeting.html">status page</a> for the LWG issues and papers that are already set up for a vote at the Cologne WG21 meeting.</p>

  <li>
    <p><a href="https://llvm.org/r364545">Revision 364545</a>	Provide hashers for <code>string_view</code> only if they are using the default <code>char_traits</code>. Reported on <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/56784597/is-libc-providing-hash-specialization-for-too-many-basic-string-views/56792608#56792608">StackOverflow</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Reworked <code>to_string</code> to use <code>to_chars</code>. Much faster, and avoids having multiple implementations. This involved reworking <code>to_chars</code> so that it was available back to C++03. <em>I did all of the <code>to_chars</code> refactoring, but not the <code>to_string</code> rework.</em></p>

<h1 id="wg21">WG21</h1>

<p>The next WG21 meeting is July 15-20 in Cologne, Germany.</p>

<p>There were no WG21 meetings in June. We (LWG) held four teleconference this month, reviewing papers in advance of the July meeting, and will have another one next week.</p>

<p>I had seven papers in the pre-Cologne mailing:</p>
<ul>
  <li><a href="https://wg21.link/P1718">P1718R0: Mandating the Standard Library: Clause 25 - Algorithms library</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://wg21.link/P1719">P1719R0: Mandating the Standard Library: Clause 26 - Numerics library</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://wg21.link/P1720">P1720R0: Mandating the Standard Library: Clause 28 - Localization library</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://wg21.link/P1721">P1721R0: Mandating the Standard Library: Clause 29 - Input/Output library</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://wg21.link/P1722">P1722R0: Mandating the Standard Library: Clause 30 - Regular Expression library</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://wg21.link/P1723">P1723R0: Mandating the Standard Library: Clause 31 - Atomics library</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://wg21.link/P1724">P1724R0: C++ Standard Library Issues to be moved in Cologne</a></li>
</ul>

<p>The goal of the July meeting is to have a “Committee Draft” (CD) of the proposed C++20 standard that can be sent out for review.</p>

<p>Also on my TODO list is to attempt to implement some of the proposals that are coming up for a vote in July (<code>flat_map</code>, text formatting, etc).</p>

<h1 id="boost">Boost</h1>

<p>The next <a href="https://www.boost.org/development/index.html">Boost release cycle</a> is in process; I am helping Michael Caisse as release manager with this release.</p>

<h1 id="conferences">Conferences</h1>

<p>Upcoming talks:</p>
<ul>
  <li><a href="https://cppconf-piter.ru/en/">C++ Russia</a> is at the end of October in St. Petersburg.</li>
  <li><a href="https://meetingcpp.com">Meeting C++</a> is in mid-November in Berlin.</li>
</ul>

<p>I have submitted a talk for <a href="https://www.cppcon.com">CppCon</a> in September, but I will not hear back about this for a month or two.</p>

<p>I submitted a talk for <a href="https://conference.accu.org">ACCU Autumn</a>, which is in Belfast right after the WG21 meeting, but I haven’t heard back about that yet. In any case, I will be attending this conference, since it’s in the same hotel as the WG21 meeting, and starts two days after the WG21 meeting, and concludes right before Meeting C++.</p>
