# Safe C++ Partnership

I am happy to announce that the C++ Alliance has formed a partnership with
Sean Baxter, a renowned engineer, to develop the
[Safe C++ Extensions proposal](https://safecpp.org/draft.html).

This is a revolutionary proposal that adds memory safety features to the C++
programming language.

This collaboration marks a significant milestone in the C++ ecosystem, as the
need for safe code has never been more pressing. With the increasing importance
of software security and reliability, developers are facing mounting pressure to
adopt safer coding practices. The Safe C++ Extensions aim to address this
critical need by introducing novel features that prevent common memory-related
errors.

We are thrilled to be working with Sean Baxter on this crucial initiative.
The Safe C++ Extensions represent a major step forward in making C++ more secure
and efficient, while preserving the language's performance and flexibility.

The Safe Standard Library is a key component of the Safe C++ Extensions proposal.
This extensive library addition will provide developers with robust, memory-safe
implementations of essential data structures and algorithms. By integrating
these components into the C++ Standard Library, we can ensure that new code is
written with safety in mind from the outset.

The C++ Alliance and Sean Baxter are seeking feedback from developers, researchers,
and other stakeholders on the Safe C++ Extensions proposal. This collaborative
process will help refine the project's scope and ensure that it addresses the most
pressing needs of the C++ ecosystem.
