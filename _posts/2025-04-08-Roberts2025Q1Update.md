We’re rolling full steam ahead into the future of Boost, and there’s never been a better time to get involved!

Behind the scenes, we’ve been hard at work improving the appearance of our documentation to make exploring Boost more inviting and easier on the eyes. Whether you're diving into a specific library or just browsing, things are looking better than ever.

We’ve also given our release report a fresh touch. Beyond technical updates, we’re now shining a light on the amazing individuals who dedicate their time and expertise to making Boost better. You’ll also find community engagement insights, like mailing list and Slack activity, to see just how alive the Boost world is.

And speaking of community...

 We’re excited to share that Boost is a proud sponsor of the June 2025 WG21 Standards Committee meeting in Sofia, Bulgaria! If you're attending, be sure to stop by — we’ll be giving out some truly amazing t-shirts. We’d love to meet you and talk all things C++ and Boost!

The future is bright, the community is strong, and we’re just getting started.
