title: "From Prototype to Product: MrDocs in 2025"

In 2024, the [MrDocs](https://www.mrdocs.com) project was a **fragile prototype**. It documented Boost.URL, but the **CLI**, **configuration**, and **build process** were unstable. Most users could not run it without direct help from the core group. That unstable baseline is the starting point for this report.

In 2025, we moved the codebase to **minimum-viable-product** shape. I led the releases that stabilized the pipeline, aligned the **configuration model**, and documented the work in this report to support a smooth **leadership transition**. This post summarizes the **2024 gaps**, the **2025 fixes**, and the **recommended directions** for the next phase.

## System Overview

[MrDocs](https://www.mrdocs.com) is a C++ documentation generator built on **Clang**. It parses source with full language fidelity, links declarations to their comments, and produces reference documentation that reflects real program structure—**templates**, **constraints**, and **overloads** included.

> Traditional tools often approximate the AST. MrDocs uses the AST directly, so documentation matches the code and modern C++ features render correctly.

Unlike single-purpose generators, MrDocs separates the **corpus** (semantic data) from the **presentation layer**. Projects can choose among multiple **output formats** or extend the system entirely: supply **custom Handlebars templates** or script new generators using the **plugin system**. The corpus is represented in the generators as a **rich JSON-like DOM**. With schema files, MrDocs enables integration with **build systems**, **documentation frameworks**, or **IDEs**.

From the user’s perspective, MrDocs behaves like a **well-engineered CLI utility**. It accepts **configuration files**, supports **relative paths**, accepts custom **build options**, and reports **warnings** in a controlled, **compiler-like** fashion. For C++ teams transitioning from **Doxygen**, the **command structure** is somewhat familiar, but the **internal model** is designed for **reproducibility** and **correctness**. Our goal is not just to render **reference pages** but to provide a **reliable pipeline** that any C++ project seeking **modern documentation infrastructure** can adopt.

## 2024: Lessons from a Fragile Prototype

MrDocs entered 2024 as a proof-of-concept built for Boost.URL. It could document one or two curated codebases and produce asciidoc pages for Antora, but the workflow stopped there. The CLI exposed only the scenarios we needed. Configuration options lived in internal notes. The only dependable build path was the script sequence we used inside the Alliance. External users hit errors and missing options almost immediately.

**Stability was just as fragile:** We had no **sanitizers**, no **warnings-as-errors**, and inconsistent **CI hardware**. The binaries crashed as soon as they saw unfamiliar code. The pipeline worked only when the input looked like Boost.URL. Point it at slightly different code patterns and it would segfault. Each feature landed as a custom patch, so logic duplicated across generators, and fixing one path broke another.

**Early releases:** Release `v0.0.1` captured that prototype: the early Handlebars engine, the HTML generator, the DOM refactor, and a list of APIs that only the core team could drive. `v0.0.2` added structured configuration, automatic `compile_commands.json`, and better SFINAE handling, but the tool was still insider-only.

**Leadership transition:** Late in 2024 I became project lead with two initial priorities: **document the gaps** and describe the **true limits** of the system. That set the 2025 baseline—a functional prototype that needed **coherence**, **reproducibility**, and **trust** before it could call itself a product.

What 2025 later fixed were the weaknesses we saw here: configuration coherence, generator unification, schema validation, and basic options were all missing. The CLI, configuration files, and code drifted apart. Generators evolved independently with duplicated code and inconsistent naming. Editors had no schema to lean on. Extraction rules were ad hoc, which made the output incomplete. CI ran on an improvised matrix with no caching, sanitizers, or coverage, so regressions slipped through. That was the starting point.

> Summary: 2024 produced a working demo, not a reproducible system. Each success exposed another weak link and clarified what had to change in 2025.

In short:

- 2024 left us with a working prototype but no coherent architecture.  
- The system could demonstrate the concept, but not sustain or reproduce it.  
- Every improvement exposed another weak link, and every success demanded more structure than the system was built to handle.  
- It was a year of learning by exhaustion—and setting the stage for everything that came next.

# 2025: From Prototype to MVP

I started the year with a gap analysis that compared MrDocs to other C++ documentation pipelines. From that review I defined the minimum viable product and three priority tracks. **Usability** covered workflows and surface area that make adoption simple. **Stability** covered deterministic behavior, proper data structures, and CI discipline. **Foundation** covered configuration and data models that keep code, flags, and documentation aligned. The 2025 releases followed those tracks and turned MrDocs from a proof of concept into a tool that other teams can adopt.

- **v0.0.3 — Consistency.** We replaced ad-hoc behavior with a coherent system: a single source of truth for configuration kept CLI, config files, and docs in sync; generators and templates were unified so changes propagate by design; core semantic extraction (e.g., concepts, constraints, SFINAE) became reliable; and CI hardened around reproducible, tested outputs across HTML and Antora.
- **v0.0.4 — Foundation.** We introduced precise warning controls and a family of `extract-*` options to match established tooling, added a JSON Schema for configuration (enabling editor validation/autocomplete), delivered a robust reference system for documentation comments, brought initial inline formatting to generators, and simplified onboarding with a cross-platform bootstrap script. CI gained sanitizers, coverage checks, and modern compilers.
- **v0.0.5 — Stabilization.** We redesigned documentation metadata to support recursive inline elements, enforced safer polymorphic types with optional references and non-nullable patterns, and added user-facing improvements (sorting, automatic compilation database detection, quick reference indices, improved namespace/overload grouping, LLDB formatters). The website and documentation UI were refreshed for accessibility and responsiveness, new demos (including self-documentation) were published, and CI was further tightened with stricter policies and cross-platform bootstrap enhancements.

Together, these releases executed the roadmap derived from the initial gap analysis: they **aligned** the moving parts, **closed** the most important capability gaps, and delivered a **stable foundation** that future work can extend without re-litigating fundamentals.

## v0.0.3: Enforcing Consistency

`v0.0.3` is where MrDocs stopped being a collection of one-off special cases and became a coherent system. Before this release, features landed in a single generator and drifted from the others; extraction handled only the narrowly requested pattern and crashed on nearby ones; and options were inconsistent—some hard-coded, some missing from CLI/config, with no mechanism to keep code, docs, and flags aligned.

**What changed:** The `v0.0.3` release fixes this foundation. We introduced a single source of truth for **configuration options** with TableGen-style metadata: docs, the config file, and the CLI always stay in sync. We added essential Doxygen-like options to make basic projects immediately usable and filled obvious gaps in symbols and doc comments.  

We implemented metadata extraction for **core symbol types** and their information—such as template constraints, **concepts**, and **automatic SFINAE** detection. We **unified generators** and templates so changes propagate by design, added **tagfile support** and “lightweight reflection” to documentation comments as **lazy DOM objects** and arrays, and **extended Handlebars** to power the new generators. These features allowed us to create the initial version of the **website** and ensure the documentation is always in sync.

**Build and testing discipline:** CI, builds, and tests were hardened. All generators were now tested, **LLVM caching** systems improved, and we launched our first **macOS release** (important for teams working on Antora UI bundles). All of this long tail of performance, correctness, and safety work turned “works on my machine” into repeatable, adoptable output across HTML and Antora.

`v0.0.3` was the inflection point. For the first time, developers could depend on consistent configuration, **shared templates**, and predictable behavior across generators. It aligned internal tools, eliminated duplicated effort, and replaced trial-and-error debugging with **reproducible builds**. Every improvement in later versions built on this foundation.

## v0.0.4: Establishing the Foundation

`v0.0.4` completed the core capabilities we need for production. With the moving parts aligned in `v0.0.3`, this release focused on the fundamentals. It added consistent **warning options**, **extraction controls** that match established tools, **schema support** for IDE auto-completion, a complete **reference system** for doc comments, and initial **inline formatting** in the generators. The **bootstrap script** became a one-step path to a working build. We also hardened the pipeline with modern **CI** practices—sanitizers, coverage integration, and standardized presets.

## v0.0.5: Stabilization and Public Readiness

`v0.0.5` marked the transition toward a **sustained development model** and prepared the project for **handoff**. This release focused on **presentation**, **polish**, and **reliability**—ensuring that MrDocs was ready not only for internal use but for public visibility. During this period, we expanded the set of **public demos**, refined the **website and documentation**, and stabilized the **infrastructure** to support a growing user base. The goal was to leave the project in a state where it could continue evolving smoothly, with a stable core, clear development practices, and a professional public face.

**Community and visibility**: Beyond the commits, this release reflected broader **activity around the project**. We generated and published several **new demos**, many of which revealed **integration issues** that were subsequently fixed. As more external users began adopting MrDocs, the **feedback loop accelerated**: bug reports, feature requests, and real-world **edge cases** guided much of the work. New contributors joined the team, collaboration became more distributed, and visibility increased. Around the same time, I introduced MrDocs to developers at **CppCon 2025**, where it received strong feedback from library authors testing it on their own projects. The tool was beginning to gain recognition as a **viable, modern alternative to Doxygen**.

**Technical progress**: This release focused on correctness. We redesigned the documentation comment data structures to support **recursive inline elements** and render **Markdown and HTML-style formatting** correctly. We moved to **non-nullable polymorphic types** and **optional references** so that invariants fail at compile time rather than at runtime. User-facing updates included new **sorting options**, **automatic compilation database detection**, a **quick reference index**, broader namespace and overload grouping, and **LLDB formatters** for Clang and MrDocs symbols. We **refreshed the website and documentation UI** for accessibility and responsiveness, added new **demos** (including the MrDocs self-reference), and tightened CI with more sanitizers, stricter warning policies, and cross-platform bootstrap improvements.

Together, these improvements completed the transition from a **developing prototype** to a **dependable product**. `v0.0.5` established a **stable foundation** for others to build on—**polished**, **documented**, and **resilient**—so future releases could focus on extending capabilities rather than consolidating them. With this release, the project reached a point where the **handoff could occur naturally**, closing one chapter and opening another.

# 2026: Beyond the MVP

MrDocs now ships a working MVP, but significant **foundational work** remains. The priority framework is the same: start with **gap analysis**, shape an **MVP** (or now just a viable product), and rank follow-on work against that baseline. In 2025 we invested in **presentation** earlier than **infrastructure**. That inversion still raises costs: each foundational change forces rework across user-facing pieces.

I do not know how the leadership model will evolve in 2026. The team might keep a single coordinator or move to shared stewardship. Regardless, the project only succeeds if we continue investing in **foundational capabilities**. The steps below outline the **recommendations** I believe will help keep MrDocs **sustainable over the long term**.

## Strategic Prioritization

Aligning **priorities** is itself the highest priority. At the start of my tenure as project lead we followed a strict sequence—**gap analysis**, then an **MVP**, then a set of **priorities**—but that model exposed limitations once work began to land. The **issue tracker** does not reflect how priorities relate to each other, and as individual tickets close the priority stack does not adjust automatically. The project’s **complexity** now amplifies the risk: without a clear view of **dependencies** we can assign a high-value engineer to a task that drags several teammates into the same bottleneck, resulting in net-negative progress. Defining priorities therefore includes understanding the team’s **skills**, mapping how they **collaborate**, and making sure no one becomes a **sink** that blocks everyone else. **Alignment** across roles remains essential so the plan reflects the people who actually execute it.

The **tooling** already exists to put this into practice. **GitHub** now lets us mark issues as **blocked by** or **blocking** others and to model **parent/child relationships**. We can use those relationships to **reorganize the priorities programmatically**. Once the relationships are encoded, **priorities gain semantic meaning** because we can explain why a small ticket matters in the larger story. Priorities become the **byproduct of higher-level goals**— narratives  about the product—rather than a short-term **static wish list** of individual features.

We also need to strengthen the **operational tools** that keep the team coordinated. **Coverage** in CI is still far below our other C++ Alliance projects, and the gap shows up as crashes whenever a new library explores an untested path in the codebase. Improving coverage is a priority in its own right. We can pair that effort with **automation** and **analysis tools** like **ReviewDog** to accelerate code-review feedback, **Danger.js** to enforce pull-request policies, **CodeClimate** or similar services for **static analysis**, and **clang-tidy** checks to catch issues earlier. Finally, we can invite other collaborators to revisit the **gap analysis** and **MVP**, including C++Alliance colleagues who specialize in **marketing**. Their perspective will help us assign priorities that reflect both **technical dependencies** and the project’s **broader positioning**.

## Reflection

The corpus keeps drifting out of sync because every important path in MrDocs duplicates representation by hand. Almost every subsystem reflects data from one format to another, and almost every internal operation traverses those structures. Each time we adjust a field we have to edit dozens of call sites, and even small mistakes create inconsistent state—different copies of the “truth” that evolve independently. Reflection eliminates this churn. If we can describe the corpus once and let the code iterate over those descriptions, the boilerplate disappears, the traversals remain correct, and we stop fighting the same battle.

A lightweight option would be to enforce the corpus from JSON the way we treat configuration, but the volume of metadata in AST makes that impractical. Instead, we lean on **compile-time reflection utilities** such as **Boost.Describe** and **Boost.mp11**. With those libraries we can convert the corpus to any representation, and each generator—including future **binary** or **JSON** targets—sees the same schema automatically. MrDocs can even emit the schema that powers each generator, keeping the schema, DOM, and documentation in sync. This approach also fixes the long-standing lag in the **XML generator**, where updates have historically been manual and error-prone.

**Process:** We can start by describing the **Symbols**, **Javadoc**, and related classes, shipping each refactor as a dedicated PR so reviews stay contained. Each description removes custom specializations, reverts to `= default` where possible, and replaces old logic with **static asserts** that enforce invariants. We generalize the main merge logic first, then update callers such as the **AST visitor** that walks `RecordTranche`, ensuring the **comments data structure** matches the new descriptions. A `MRDOCS_DESCRIBE_DERIVED` helper can enumerate derived classes so every visit routine becomes generic. Once the C++ side is described, we rebuild the lazy DOM objects on top of Describe so their types mirror the DOM layout directly.

**Use cases:** Redundant non-member functions like `tag_invoke`, `operator⇔`, `toString`, and `merge` collapse into **shared implementations** that use traits unless real customization is required. New generators—binary, JSON, or otherwise—drop in with minimal code because the schema and traversal logic already exist. The XML generator stops maintaining a private representation and simply reads the described elements. We can finally standardize **naming conventions** (kebab-case or camelCase) because the schema enforces them. Generating the **Relax NG Compact** file becomes just another output produced from the same description. A metadata walker can then discover auxiliary objects and emit **DOM documentation automatically**. As a side effect of integrating Boost.mp11, we can extend the `tag_invoke` context protocol with tuple-based helpers for `mrdocs::FromValue`, further narrowing the gap between concrete and DOM objects.

## Metadata

MrDocs still carries metadata gaps that are too large to ignore. The subsections below highlight the three extraction areas that demand sustained effort; each of them blocks the rest of the system from staying consistent.

**Recursive blocks and inlines.** Release 0.0.5 introduced the data structures for recursive Javadoc elements, but we still do not parse all of those structures. The fix is straightforward in concept—extend the CommonMark-based parser so every block and inline variant becomes a first-class node—but the implementation is long because there are many element types. We can ship this incrementally by opening issues and sub-issues, tackling one structure per PR, and starting with block elements before moving to inlines. The existing post-process documentation finalizer already contains the mechanics; we just need to wire each rule into the new documentation nodes.

**Legible names.** The current name generator appends hash fragments to differentiate symbols lazily, which makes references unstable and awkward. We need a stable allocator that remembers which symbols claimed which names. The highest-priority symbol should receive the base name, and suffixes should cascade to less critical overloads so the visible entries stay predictable. Moving the generator into the extraction phase and storing the assignments there ensures anchors remain stable, lets us update artifacts such as the Boost.URL tagfile, and produces names that actually read well.

**Populate expressions.** Whenever the extractor fails to recognize an expression, it falls back to the raw source string. That shortcut prevents us from applying the usual transformations, especially inside requires-expressions where implementation-defined symbols appear. We should introduce typed representations for the constructs we already understand and continue to store strings for the expressions we have not modeled yet. As coverage grows, more expressions flow through the structured pipeline, and the remaining string-based nodes shrink to the truly unknown cases.

## Extensions and Plugins

**Extensions** and **plugins** aim at the same outcome—letting projects **customize MrDocs**—but they operate at different layers. Extensions run **inside the application**, usually through **interpreters** we bundle. We already ship **Lua** and **Duktape**, yet today they only power a handful of **Handlebars helpers**. The plan is to widen that surface: add more interpreters where it makes sense, extend helper support so extensions can participate in **escaping** and **formatting**, and give extensions the ability to **consume the entire corpus**. With that access, an extension can list every symbol, emit metadata in formats we do not yet support, or transform the corpus before it reaches a native generator. The same mechanism enables **quality-of-life utilities**, such as a generator extension that checks whether a library’s public API changed according to a policy defined in code.

**Plugins**, by contrast, are **compiled artifacts**. They unlock similar customization goals, but their **ABI must stay stable**, and platform differences mean a plugin built on one system will not run on another. To keep the surface manageable we should expose a **narrow wrapper**: pass plugins a set of **DOM proxies** so they never depend on the underlying **Info classes**, use **traits** or **versioned interfaces** to handle incompatibilities, and **plan the API carefully** before release. 

## Dependency Resilience

Working with **dependent libraries** is still the most fragile part of the MrDocs workflow. **Environments drift**, **transitive dependencies change** without notice, and heavyweight projects force us to install **toolchains** we do not actually need. In **Boost.URL** alone we watch upstream Boost libraries evolve every few weeks; sometimes the code truly breaks, but just as often a new release exercises an untested path in MrDocs and triggers a crash because our **coverage** is still thin. Other ecosystems push the cost even higher: documenting a library that depends on **LLVM** can turn a three-second render into an hours-long process because the transitive LLVM **headers** MrDocs needs are generated at build time, so we must compile and install LLVM merely to obtain include files. **CI environments** regularly fail for the same reason.

We already experimented with **mitigation strategies** and should refine them rather than abandon the ideas. Shipping a **curated standard library** with MrDocs removes one entire category of instability. The option will soon be disabled by default, but users can still enable it or even combine it with the system library when **reproducibility** matters more than access to system libraries. This mirrors how **Clang** ships **libc++**; it does not allow invalid code, it simply guarantees a known baseline.

On top of that, we have preliminary support for **user-defined stubs**. **Configuration files** can provide short descriptions of expected symbols from hard-to-build dependencies, and MrDocs can **inject those during extraction**. For predictable patterns we can **auto-generate stubs** when the user opts in, synthesizing symbols rather than failing immediately. None of this accepts invalid code—the compiler still diagnoses real errors—but it shields projects from breakage when a **transitive dependency** tweaks implementation details or when generated headers are unavailable. The features remain **optional**, so teams can disable synthesis to debug the underlying issue and still benefit from the faster path when schedules are tight. Even if the project moves in another direction we should **document the proposal** and remove the existing stub hooks deliberately rather than letting them linger undocumented.

The payoffs are clear. **Boost libraries** could generate documentation without cloning the entire super-project, relying on **SettingsDB** to produce a **compilation database** and skipping **CMake** entirely. MrDocs itself could publish reference docs without building **LLVM** because the required symbols would come from stubs. **Releases** would stop breaking every time a transitive dependency changes, and developers would regain hours currently spent firefighting. These are the **stability** and **reproducibility** gains we need if we want MrDocs to be the **default tooling** for large C++ ecosystems.

# Conclusion

The 2025 releases unified the generators, locked the configuration model, added sanitizers and coverage to CI, and introduced features that make the tool usable outside Boost.URL. The project is ready for new contributors because they can extend the code without rebuilding the basics, and downstream teams can run the CLI on large codebases and expect predictable output.

While we delivered those releases, I learned that engineering progress depends on steady communication. Remote discussions often sound negative even when people agree on the goals, so I schedule short check-ins, add light signals like emojis, and keep space for conversations that are not task-driven. I also protect time to listen and ask for help when the workload gets heavy; if I lose that time, every deadline slips anyway.

**Final Reflections**

- Technical conversations start negative by default, so add clear signals when you agree or appreciate the work.
- Assume terse feedback comes from the medium, not the person, and respond with patience.
- Keep informal connection habits—buddy calls, breaks, or quick chats—to maintain trust.
- Look after your own health and use outside support when needed.
- Never allow the schedule to block real listening time; reset your calendar when that happens.
